# DFlash checkpoint qualification

This is the model-qualification stage of [RFC #825](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-metal/issues/825).
It provides a native Qwen3 DFlash block forward and a numerical comparison tool.
It does **not** enable `method="dflash"` in vLLM serving.

The first reference checkpoint is
[z-lab/Qwen3-4B-DFlash-b16](https://huggingface.co/z-lab/Qwen3-4B-DFlash-b16/tree/b74e3a329c4d963783143b1e970d95b002be72bd),
paired with Qwen3-4B. It has **five draft layers** and a 16-position block:
one anchor and 15 predictions. It does not fulfill the RFC's preferred
three-layer milestone. Quantized target conversions borrow their own actual
embedding and output projection; comparisons use that same target precision.

## Model contract

- Checkpoint target layer IDs name zero-based decoder outputs before final
  normalization. `DFlashConfig.capture_layer_ids` translates
  `[1, 9, 17, 25, 33]` to the shared capture bridge's `[2, 10, 18, 26, 34]`,
  preserving order.
- Each block attends to the complete committed context and every position
  within its own block. Proposal logits come from slots 1 onward.
- The caller supplies the target projections and full-prefix features.
  The model stores no borrowed target weights or persistent KV state.
- The initial loader accepts a local, unsharded z-lab Qwen3 checkpoint with
  uniform FP32, FP16, or BF16 weights, full attention, and default RoPE.
  Incompatible tensor names, shapes, precision, non-finite weights, and
  unsupported checkpoint semantics fail explicitly.
- Target geometry checks establish structural compatibility. Use the target
  named by the checkpoint's model card; equal geometry alone does not establish
  tokenizer identity or training compatibility.

## Reproduce the numerical comparison

Download these snapshots with the Hugging Face CLI; it prints each local path:

```bash
hf download mlx-community/Qwen3-4B-4bit \
    --revision 4dcb3d101c2a062e5c1d4bb173588c54ea6c4d25
hf download z-lab/Qwen3-4B-DFlash-b16 \
    --revision b74e3a329c4d963783143b1e970d95b002be72bd
```

locally, then run from the repository's development environment:

```bash
python -m tools.dflash_parity \
    --target /path/to/target/snapshot \
    --draft /path/to/draft/snapshot \
    --reference /path/to/model_mlx.py \
    --output /path/to/new-results.json
```

The tool uses both capture implementations and compares draft logits and greedy
proposal IDs at batch sizes 1 and 2, context lengths 17, 33, and 65, and block
sizes 2, 5, and 16. It records exact equality separately from the numerical
tolerance (`atol=rtol=1e-3`), rejects non-finite or incomplete comparisons, and
fails on any proposal mismatch. The report includes snapshot paths, native and
reference source hashes, and library versions. Use a new output file for each run.

This is forward parity, not generated-sequence parity or a performance benchmark.
The independent small-model tests also compare against explicit CPU attention
math and check that a causal block mask produces a different result.

## Serving milestones

The qualification forward recomputes context K/V with MLX attention. Serving
integration must bind committed draft KV to scheduler-owned `KVCacheStorage`,
use scheduler lookahead for temporary block writes, and express the block mask
through Metal paged attention. The first experimental serving stage must reject
prefix caching, as requested in the RFC. Lifecycle correctness, generated-token
parity, and batch-1/batch-N serving measurements remain separate gates before
claiming DSpark support or acceleration.
