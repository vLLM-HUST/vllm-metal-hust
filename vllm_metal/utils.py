    A lazily allocated KV pool is unbacked, so nothing tells the machine -- or
    the user -- whether the pool fits until a request writes a block, and by
    then the answer arrives mid-generation as a swap storm or a jetsam kill.
    Touching one byte per page asks the question at startup, where the answer
    is still cheap to act on: size the pool down, or refuse to start.

    The sample lives in its own anonymous mapping, so closing it drops the pages
    outright: this is a check, not a reservation, and it does not hand the lazy
    pool a resident footprint. (Anonymous pages freed by ``munmap`` are recycled
    rather than written to swap, so nothing of the sample is left for the next
    allocation to inherit.)

    Paging is read from the kernel's cumulative compressor and swap-file
    counters (see :func:`_paging_counters`) rather than swap occupancy, which
    both rises and falls during a probe and so can hide the writes this is
    looking for. The compressor comes first: macOS compresses other pages to
    make room before it writes swap, so a probe that reads only the swap file
    misses a sample the compressor absorbed.
    ``available_after`` is read once the sample has
    been dropped, so the pair describes the machine before the probe and with
    the probe's memory already back.
