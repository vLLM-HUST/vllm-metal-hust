"""Per-query image-block ranges for the tiled prefill kernel (Gemma 4 vision).

Mirrors vLLM's ``fill_mm_prefix_query_ranges`` (``vllm/v1/attention/backends/
utils.py``): every query row of the batch carries the inclusive absolute
``[start, end]`` of the image block it lies in, ``(-1, -1)`` otherwise.  The
kernel unmasks ``start <= key <= end`` for such rows on top of the causal rule
and ANDs the sliding window afterwards, which is HF's
``(causal OR same_block) AND window``.

Leaf module: numpy only, so the attention impl and tests can import it
without MLX or torch.
